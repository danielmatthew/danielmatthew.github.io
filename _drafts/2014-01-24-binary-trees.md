title: Binary Trees

*This is one of a series based around the mastery of core Computer Science concepts - please read for the skinny.*

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. The degree of such a tree cannot be greater than two. Binary trees are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting: unlike a linked list where you must follow the nodes until the result is found, a binary tree allows one to halve the numbers of nodes that must be considered on each search iteration.

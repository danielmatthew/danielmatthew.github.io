title: Naming Things Is Hard

A popular Computer Science joke goes like this:

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
> 1) Naming things

I've recently been working on a responsive redesign for a client, and found that a common problem is not how to write the CSS to style an element, but what to name the colour variable, the Sass partial, or the reusable code block. I've found myself wringing my hands trying to think of something that's both generic but still informative. What makes sense and sounds useful at the start of a project can quickly cause one to become backed into a corner. Technical debt acrues as you continue to put off renaming `.home-product-category` to `.product-category`, or `$text-colour` as `$sky-blue`.

title: Big O Notation
---

## What is Big O Notation?
- Helps determine the efficiency of an algorithm
- At its heart, Big O Notation is a way to express complexity. For a problem of size N:
-- A constant-time method is 'order 1', or O(1)
-- A linear-time method is 'order N', or O(N)
-- A quadratic-time method is order N squared, or O(N²)

A constant-time method will be faster than a linear-time method, which will be faster than a quadratic-time method.

### O(1)
### O(N)
### O(N²)
Performance directly proportional to the square of the size of the data set.
### O(2n)
Algorithm whose growth doubles with each additional element in the data set. Quickly becomes very large.
### O(log	N)
Logarithmic curve - imagine graph of half-life. 
> Theoretical limit for searching a data set.

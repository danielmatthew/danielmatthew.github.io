`bind()` was introduced in 2009â€™s ECMAScript 5 specification. It can be used to perform a _partial function application_. A new function is created that calls the original, and specifies a number of new arguments.

For example, bind can be used to create a new function that is like `add()`, but only requires one parameter, as y is always 1:

{% highlight js %}
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

var plus1 = add.bind(null, 1);
console.log(plus1(5)); // 6
{% endhighlight %}

If you have a website or SPA that you'd like to ensure works across mobile, tablet, desktop, I'd love to hear from you. Using the latest in web standards, I write clean and semantic markup, concise stylesheets using the power of Sass, and add interactions with modern JavaScript.

That said, I'm open to listening to interesting opportunities outside that remit. If my experiences in delivering mobile advertising solutions, hybrid mobile applications, and high-trafficked websites will complement your team, bring me in-house and lets see what we can achieve together.

I'm a specialist in building responsive and elegant web user interfaces for applications and customer-facing websites alike. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fundamentals, but I also possess a command of web technologies old and new. I use these technologies intelligently and appropriately to deliver experiences for a global audience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
